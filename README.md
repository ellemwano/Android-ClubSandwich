# ClubSandwich
Project #0 of the [Android Developer](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Project Overview
Download the [starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code) and complete the **ClubSandwich** app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Learning objectives
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## Project requirements
- JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils
- JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries
- DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly
- Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices
- Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label
